# Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository features a comprehensive and practical implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs), with examples and project challenges to help users gain real experience applying LLMs.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains 2 different LLM projects:

#### 1. Beginners Guide to LLM

- **Notebook**: `Beginners Guide to LLM/Beginners_Guide_LLM_on_Collab.ipynb`
- **Objective**: Basic introductory code for running LLM using Google AI on Colab
- **Status**: Ready for training

#### 2. AI Quiz Master

- **Notebook**: `AI_QuizMaster/Quiz_Master_from_Text_Book.ipynb`
- **Content**: Dataset containing Quiz Questions from University Text Books
- **Objective**: Build an ChatGPT style LLM for reading a Quiz Bank and posing Quiz questions for students to practice using Google AI on Colab
- **Status**: Ready for training

#### 3. AI Bank Statement Analyzer

- **Notebook**: `AI Bank Statement Analyzer/AI_Bank_Statement_Analyzer.ipynb`
- **Objective**: Practical use of AI LLM for Analysing Bank Statement and give visual
                 summary of the transactions. Furthermore , it uses AI to categorize expenses and plots them on a graph.
- **Status**: Ready for training

## Getting Started

1. Click Open in Colab to open in Google Colab
2. Install required Python packages for LLM (as defined in the Notebook):
3. Follow the training process and experiment with different architectures
